In this project, I have develope a device for the measurement of Sympathetic Nervous Signals emanating from the human body. This endeavor is a significant milestone in my research journey as a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

In the initial phase of the project, I meticulously design a printed circuit board (PCB) equipped with an Analog Electrocardiogram (ECG) front-end to capture ECG signals. I also undertake the task of writing the firmware for the microcontroller board. Notably, I employ the STM32F405RGT6 microcontroller unit (MCU) for this purpose.

In the subsequent stage of the project, I harness the power of the STM32F405RGT6 MCU to execute Digital Signal Processing (DSP) on the acquired signals. To assess the efficacy of the DSP performed by the STM32F405RGT6 MCU, I employ MATLAB software for signal processing as well. This comprehensive analysis allow for a detailed comparison of the results obtained through both methods.
